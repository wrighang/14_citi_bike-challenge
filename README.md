Data Clean-up

## Background
Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike webpage](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Requirements
### Map
- Markers for all bike stations
- Station markers indicate popularity by color, size, shape, or some other means
- Ability to change marker data based on month and year
- Sections are marked by zip code
- A write-up on the trends that were discovered while making the map

### Visualizations
- 4-10 total visualizations
- A total of 2 Tableau dashboards, each dedicated to a specific data discovery
- Dashboards are named appropriately
- Data is cleaned such that data entry errors are removed and columns are correctly typed
- Visualizations can logically be used to explore the data

### Tableau Story
- Individual visualizations are used
- Dashboards are used
- A map is used
- Visualizations on the same page are clearly related to one another
- The story is informative and easy to navigate

### Analysis
- Analysis is written in a markdown file or included in the Tableau Public workbook
- Analysis describes the dashboards and any interesting data discoveries contained within them
- Analysis on the chosen city official requested map detailing any noticeable trends
- The written analysis references specific visualizations and interactive features
- The document is written in a manner that a non-technical reader could understand

## CODING_PROCESS

This assignment was a both fun and time consuming and provided me with learning opportunities along with way. It all began with me wanting to do a year over year analysis leading me to downloaded several zip files, each containing 3 enormous dataset files. After cleaning the data is VS Code, and loading the data into Tableau I realized that the size of the files were slowing down Tableau significantly. To move through this quicker, I pivoted to using Jersey City specific files which are much smalller. 
After visualizing the Jersey City data for 2022 and 2023, I decided to expand the time frame to 2019-2024 focusing on June and December becuase June has the longest daylight hours and December has the shortest.
The silverlining is I was able to learn new ways of cleaning data. Some areas of assistance that I noted during the process:
- Used assistance for the code for removing miliseconds and changing to date time format
- Used assitance for the code for calculating distance in miles using longitude and latitude
- Used assistnace for coding calcualtions in Tableau
